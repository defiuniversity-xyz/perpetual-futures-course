## 🎓 How to Use This Course

Each lesson includes:

- **Detailed Explanations**: Beginner-friendly introductions with advanced deep-dives
- **Mathematical Formulas**: Explained intuitively with real-world examples
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on assessments and calculation worksheets
- **Visual Aids**: Infographics and diagrams to reinforce concepts
- **Protocol Comparisons**: Learn when to use which protocol for maximum efficiency

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Risk First**: Understanding liquidation mechanics and margin requirements protects your capital. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

2. **Architecture Matters**: CLOB protocols offer CEX-like experience. Oracle pools offer zero slippage but carry different risks. Choose based on your strategy.

3. **Start Small**: Begin with low leverage and isolated margin. Master basics before advanced strategies.

4. **Funding Rates Matter**: High funding rates can erode profits. Always check before opening positions.

5. **Multi-Protocol**: Different protocols excel at different things. Learn multiple platforms to optimize your strategies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with **Lesson 1: Understanding Perpetual Futures Fundamentals**
2. Complete the exercises for each lesson before moving on
3. Use the provided calculators and frameworks in exercises
4. Practice with small positions and low leverage initially
5. Monitor positions closely and understand liquidation risks

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **Liquidation Risk is Real**: Positions can be liquidated if margin requirements aren't met, resulting in total loss of collateral
- **Funding Rate Costs**: High funding rates can consume profits, especially on leveraged positions
- **Oracle Risk**: Price feed manipulation or latency can cause unexpected liquidations
- **Smart Contract Risk**: All DeFi protocols carry technical risk
- **Bridge Risk**: Moving assets between chains introduces custody risk
- **Not Financial Advice**: This course teaches mechanics, not investment recommendations
